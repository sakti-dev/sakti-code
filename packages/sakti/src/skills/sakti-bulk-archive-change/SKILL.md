Archive multiple completed changes in a single operation.

This skill allows you to batch-archive changes, handling spec conflicts intelligently by checking the codebase to determine what's actually implemented.

**Input**: None required (prompts for selection)

## Steps

### 1. Get active changes

Run `sakti list --json` to get all active changes.

If no active changes exist, inform user and stop.

### 2. Prompt for change selection

Use **AskUserQuestion tool** with multi-select to let user choose changes:
- Show each change with its schema
- Include an option for "All changes"
- Allow any number of selections (1+ works, 2+ is the typical use case)

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT auto-select. Always let the user choose.

### 3. Batch validation — gather status for all selected changes

For each selected change, collect:

a. **Artifact status** — Run `sakti status --change "<name>" --json`
   - Parse `schemaName` and `artifacts` list
   - Note which artifacts are `done` vs other states

b. **Task completion** — Read `.sakti/changes/<name>/tasks.md`
   - Count `- [ ]` (incomplete) vs `- [x]` (complete)
   - If no tasks file exists, note as "No tasks"

c. **Delta specs** — Check `.sakti/changes/<name>/specs/` directory
   - List which capability specs exist
   - For each, extract requirement names (lines matching `### Requirement: <name>`)

### 4. Detect spec conflicts

Build a map of `capability -> [changes that touch it]`:

```
auth -> [change-a, change-b]  <- CONFLICT (2+ changes)
api  -> [change-c]            <- OK (only 1 change)
```

A conflict exists when 2+ selected changes have delta specs for the same capability.

### 5. Resolve conflicts agentically

**For each conflict**, investigate the codebase:

a. **Read the delta specs** from each conflicting change to understand what each claims to add/modify

b. **Search the codebase** for implementation evidence:
   - Look for code implementing requirements from each delta spec
   - Check for related files, functions, or tests

c. **Determine resolution**:
   - If only one change is actually implemented → sync that one's specs
   - If both implemented → apply in chronological order (older first, newer overwrites)
   - If neither implemented → skip spec sync, warn user

d. **Record resolution** for each conflict:
   - Which change's specs to apply
   - In what order (if both)
   - Rationale (what was found in codebase)

### 6. Show consolidated status table

```
| Change              | Artifacts | Tasks | Specs   | Conflicts | Status |
|---------------------|-----------|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| schema-management   | Done      | 5/5   | 2 delta | None      | Ready  |
| project-config      | Done      | 3/3   | 1 delta | None      | Ready  |
| add-oauth           | Done      | 4/4   | 1 delta | auth (!)  | Ready* |
| add-verify-skill    | 1 left    | 2/5   | None    | None      | Warn   |
```

For conflicts, show the resolution.
For incomplete changes, show warnings.

### 7. Confirm batch operation

Use **AskUserQuestion tool** with a single confirmation:
- "Archive N changes?" with options based on status
- Options might include:
  - "Archive all N changes"
  - "Archive only N ready changes (skip incomplete)"
  - "Cancel"

### 8. Execute archive for each confirmed change

Process changes in the determined order (respecting conflict resolution):

a. **Sync specs** if delta specs exist:
   - Use the `/sakti:sync-specs` approach (agent-driven intelligent merge)
   - For conflicts, apply in resolved order
   - Track if sync was done

b. **Perform the archive**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .sakti/changes/archive
   mv .sakti/changes/<name> .sakti/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>
   ```

c. **Track outcome** for each change:
   - Success: archived successfully
   - Failed: error during archive (record error)
   - Skipped: user chose not to archive (if applicable)

### 9. Display summary

```
## Bulk Archive Complete

Archived 3 changes:
- schema-management-cli -> archive/2026-01-19-schema-management-cli/
- project-config -> archive/2026-01-19-project-config/
- add-oauth -> archive/2026-01-19-add-oauth/

Skipped 1 change:
- add-verify-skill (user chose not to archive incomplete)

Spec sync summary:
- 4 delta specs synced to main specs
- 1 conflict resolved (auth: applied both in chronological order)
```

## Conflict Resolution Examples

**Example 1: Only one implemented**
```
Conflict: specs/auth/spec.md touched by [add-oauth, add-jwt]

Checking add-oauth:
- Delta adds "OAuth Provider Integration" requirement
- Searching codebase... found src/auth/oauth.ts implementing OAuth flow

Checking add-jwt:
- Delta adds "JWT Token Handling" requirement
- Searching codebase... no JWT implementation found

Resolution: Only add-oauth is implemented. Will sync add-oauth specs only.
```

**Example 2: Both implemented**
```
Conflict: specs/api/spec.md touched by [add-rest-api, add-graphql]

Resolution: Both implemented. Will apply add-rest-api specs first,
then add-graphql specs (chronological order, newer takes precedence).
```

## Guardrails

- Allow any number of changes (1+ is fine, 2+ is the typical use case)
- Always prompt for selection, never auto-select
- Detect spec conflicts early and resolve by checking codebase
- When both changes are implemented, apply specs in chronological order
- Skip spec sync only when implementation is missing (warn user)
- Show clear per-change status before confirming
- Use single confirmation for entire batch
- Track and report all outcomes (success/skip/fail)
- Preserve `.sakti.yaml` when moving to archive
- Archive directory target uses current date: `YYYY-MM-DD-<name>`
- If archive target exists, fail that change but continue with others
