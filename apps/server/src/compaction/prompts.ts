[What is the user trying to accomplish? Can be multiple items if the session covers different tasks.]

- [Any constraints, preferences, or requirements mentioned by user]
- [Or "(none)" if none were mentioned]

## Progress
### Done
- [x] [Completed tasks/changes]

### In Progress
- [ ] [Current work]

### Blocked
- [Issues preventing progress, if any]

## Key Decisions
- **[Decision]**: [Brief rationale]

## Next Steps
1. [Ordered list of what should happen next]

## Critical Context
- [Any data, examples, or references needed to continue]

- PRESERVE all existing information from the previous summary

- UPDATE the Progress section: move items from "In Progress" to "Done" when completed
- UPDATE "Next Steps" based on what was accomplished
- PRESERVE exact file paths, function names, and error messages
- If something is no longer relevant, you may remove it

Use this EXACT format:

## Goal
[Preserve existing goals, add new ones if the task expanded]

## Constraints & Preferences
- [Preserve existing, add new ones discovered]

## Progress
### Done
- [x] [Include previously done items AND newly completed items]

### In Progress
- [ ] [Current work - update based on progress]

### Blocked
- [Current blockers - remove if resolved]

## Key Decisions
- **[Decision]**: [Brief rationale] (preserve all previous, add new)

## Next Steps
